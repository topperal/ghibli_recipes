        <ol Instructions:>
            <li>Cut up the potatoes and put them in a pot of boiling water.  Boil for about 5 minutes, then add in two eggs and boil for 5 more minutes.  Take out the eggs, and strain the potatoes.  Then mash the potatoes in a bowl with 2/3 cup of milk.</li>
            <li>Add the mashed potatoes to the bottom of your casserole dish, saving about 1 potato worth of mash in the bowl.</li>
            <li>Slice all of the vegetables and the hardboiled eggs and saute them in a pan with some oil or butter and the bay leaves.</li>
            <li>Add in the rest of the milk, the mashed potato that you saved, mustard, salt and pepper.  Cook everything on medium heat stirring occasionally, until the milk reaches a thick consistency, then add it into the casserole pan.  Remember to remove the bay leaves.</li>
            <li>Cut the fish fillets into 3 inch wide chunks, and then add it into the casserole pan.</li>
            <li>Unroll the pie crust and put it on top.  You can cut it into strips, and cut out a fish if you want to make it like the one in Kiki`s Delivery Service.  Once you finish covering the casserole pan with the pie crust, beat an egg and brush it on top of the pie crust.</li>
            <li>Bake in a 350 degree oven for about 20-30 minutes, or until the crust is to your liking.</li>
            <li>Now you can eat it! Itadakimasu!</li>
