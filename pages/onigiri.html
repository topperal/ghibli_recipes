                <h2>Instructions:</h2>
                <ol Instructions: >
                    <li>Start by slicing your nori sheets in half lengthwise. 
                        Mix the mayonnaise into your salmon until well coated. 
                        Set the salmon mix and nori aside.</li>
                    <li>If you`re using freshly cooked rice, wait until the rice
                        is cool enough to handle. If using cold leftover rice, 
                        reheat it in a microwave at 30 second intervals until 
                        slightly warm—not hot. This way, the rice won`t go 
                        cold before you`re finished working with it.</li>
                    <li>Put the cookie cutter on a flat surface. Place an 8″x8″
                        sheet of plastic wrap over the cookie cutter and push 
                        some of it down inside so that the inside of the 
                        cookie cutter is completely lined with plastic wrap. 
                        Scoop approximately 2 tbsp of rice into the bottom of 
                        the cutter and press it flat with a plastic spoon or 
                        small rubber spatula (the rice won`t stick to the tools
                        as much as it sticks to fingers!). When flattening the
                        rice, push it around so that it reaches right up to 
                        the corners of the cutter. Place 
                        1 tsp salmon filling into the middle of the rice, 
                        spreading it around just a little, so there will be 
                        a little salmon in each bite of rice when you`re 
                        finished.</li>
                    <li>
                        Place a couple more tablespoons of rice on top and flatten 
                        out as before. Wrap the plastic tightly over the exposed 
                        end of the onigiri and pop it out of the cookie cutter. 
                        Firmly wrap any loose ends around the outside of the onigiri. Set aside.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Repeat with remaining rice and salmon until you run out of ingredients.
                    </li>
                    <li>Let the onigiri set for 5-10 minutes. If planning to eat them later, 
                        place them on a baking sheet and chill until ready to serve.</li>
                    <li>When ready to serve, remove the plastic wrap and press a nori strip around 
                        the bottom of each onigiri. The rice should still be sticky 
                        enough that the nori adheres with no problems.</li>
                    <li>Now you can eat it! Itadakimasu!</li>
